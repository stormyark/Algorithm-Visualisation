# Algorithm Visualisation

This project is a visualization tool for sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive, graphical representation of various sorting techniques, allowing you to see how the algorithms work step-by-step.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms:** Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Counting Sort.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Use a range slider to change the visualization speed.
- **Random Array Generation:** Easily create a new random array to be sorted.
- **Interactive UI:** Choose between different sorting algorithms using a dropdown menu.

## Technologies

- **HTML5:** For structure and layout.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing sorting logic and dynamic visualization on an HTML Canvas.
